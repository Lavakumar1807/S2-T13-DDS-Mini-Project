  <summary>Detail</summary>

  1. **Motivation**:
   There are situations where people do not know about the events happening and feel unsatisfied
after choosing an event to go to. This project aims for providing a clear blueprint of the event
by classifying all sub-events and problems that are faced in events. So, this event navigator
suggests the individual to proper event according to their interest. This makes the individual
more satisfied and enjoy the event.
This also helps the event manager to conduct further events based on the strength attended
to each event and tracking the major interest of people attending their events.

2. **Problem Statement**:
   Our project focused on building a state machine for live event navigator utilizing the con-
cepts of digital systems, aims for easy navigation between the events going on in a concert or
exhibition. This system puts forward an innovative solution to the individual by keeping them
conscious of the ongoing events through various mediums. It focuses on people’s satisfaction
and their experience towards the event.

3. **Features**:

   •  **Categorizing by event type**:</t>
   > Categorizing by event type helps in organizing events
into various groups based on their characteristics.
   
   •  **Switching between events**:
   > This feature allows individual to navigate between events
easily.

   •  **Seat Allotment**:
   > This dynamic allocation feature allows individual to identify current
availability of seats.
   
   •  **Ticketing system**:
   > This type of system facilitates tax payers and differentiates them
from others.
   
   •  **Time**:
   > Indicating the time helps the individual to know the current status of the event.
   
   •  **Emergency Alarm**:
   > Featuring emergency alarm helps the people to vacate the event
immediately during unfortunate disruptions.
